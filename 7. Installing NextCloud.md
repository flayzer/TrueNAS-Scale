5. Enable **Apply Group** and **Apply permissions recursively**.
6. Click **Save**

2. Install the **Truenas Charts** version. Even though this is updated ledd often, it is more stable.
3. Under **Nextcloud Configuration**, set the administrator username and password.
4. Click **Add** to add a local host path.
5. Scroll down to **Storage** and enable **Enable Host Path for Nextcloud Data Volume**.
6. Browse and select the host path, and then copy and paste it into the **Nextcloud data directory** field. (Under Nextcloud Configuration. Scroll up a bit).
