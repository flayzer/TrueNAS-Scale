Follow these steps to install and configure Plex Media Server on TrueNAS:

## Prepare the Storage
We are going to need three different storage volumes. Create these datasets in whichever pool you like.
- Transcode Volume
- Data Volume
- Config Volume

## Installing Plex Media Server
1. Log in to TrueNAS. From the dashboard screen, select "apps" in the left-side menu.
2. Select the **Avaialable Applications** tab and search for *Plex*.
3. Click install.
4. Visit [plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim/) to get your claim token.
5. Copy and paste this token into the **Plex Claim Token** field.
6. Check the **Configure Host Network** under Networking.
7. Configure the storage section. Set the host path for the `Transcode Volume`, `Data Volume`, and `Config Volume`.
8. Finally click save.

Once the TrueNAS setup is complete, your application will be ready for use.

Note:  With TrueNAS Scale, you donâ€™t have to add an automatic start. As long as your host is up and running, your app will also be running. If you restart your host for any reason, you must head back to Installed Applications and manually start your Plex.

## Plex Configuration

2. Click on **Installed Applications**.
3. Find `Plex` and click on the **Web Portal** button.

6. In the Media Library tab, select the content type you want and the location of the media.
7. Add as many libraries as you need and click **next**
8. Finally, click **Done** to complete the server setup.
