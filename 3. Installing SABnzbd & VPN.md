## Prepare Storage
Before installing SABnzbd and VPN, we need to set up the necessary storage configurations.

1. Create a dataset for your download cache. This dataset will be used to store downloaded data before moving it to PlexMedia.
2. Ensure that you have an SMB share set up for the next section. This will allow easy file transfer between systems. If you don't have an SMB share set up click [here](1.%20installing%20truenas%20scale.md/#smb-share)

## Prepare VPN
To set up the VPN for your TrueNAS SCALE system, follow these steps:

1. Visit [this page](https://my.surfshark.com/vpn/manual-setup/main/openvpn).
2. Click on the **Credentials** tab and save the provided credentials for later use.
3. Click on the **Locations** tab, select a preferred location, and click on **Download TCP**.
4. Copy the downloaded file to your TrueNAS system using the SMB share. You can move this file to a more appropriate location later.

## Add App from TrueCharts
To install SABnzbd using TrueCharts, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Apps** page from the top-level SCALE menu.
2. Select the **Available Applications** tab.
3. Search for SABnzbd in the search bar.
4. Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.
5. Under **Storage and Persistence** add your additional App Storage (Download-Cache & Location of .ovpn file)
6. Scroll down to the **VPN** section in the right-side menu.
7. Select **OpenVPN (Deprecated)** as the type.
8. Enter the authentication username and password saved earlier.
9. Optionally, enable the killswitch to disconnect the internet if the VPN fails or disconnects. You can exclude specific networks from the killswitch if needed.
10. Specify the location of the downloaded Locations file under **VPN Config File Location**.
11. Customize the other configuration options according to your preferences. You can keep the default settings if you're unsure.

That's it! You have now installed SABnzbd and set up the necessary VPN configurations. You can proceed to further configuration and customization based on your requirements.
